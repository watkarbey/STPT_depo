About this script
This is a checking script for the TissueCyte data. The naming convention of the data is as follows. Let's assume the name of the marmoset sample is TT36. The name of the parent folder is "tissuecyte". This folder contains the data produced by a series of runs, which are designated as TT36A, TT36B, TT36C, etc in order. The operating software asks the sample ID for each run. We take care to make it identical in all these runs. We make it TT36B (for bilateral) in this example. In each of these run folders, one metadata file named Mosaic_TT36B is generated, which stores the parameters for this run, which dictate X and Y steps for tiling and Z steps for sectioning. When the run is cancelled on the way, you need to manually change the Z step number. The image data for each section is stored in separate folders, e.g., TT36B-0101, TT36B0102, .. In each of these section folders, the image tiles for the block face in three color channels are stored, together with a metadata file that records the XY position of the tile. This python script checks the number of files and metadata files to see if it contains the correct number of files in a correct manner. If there is a problem in the data integrity, it tells you where the problem lies.
